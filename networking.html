    <h2>1. DNS (Domain Name System)</h2>
    <p>
        When you type <strong>memefiele1.github.io/cn-project-1</strong> into a browser,
        DNS translates that domain name into an IP address so your browser knows which
        server to connect to. Running <code>nslookup memefiele1.github.io</code> returns
        four IPv4 addresses: 185.199.108.153, 185.199.109.153, 185.199.110.153, and
        185.199.111.153 — GitHub Pages uses multiple servers for load balancing.
    </p>

    <h2>2. IP Addressing</h2>
    <p>
        This site resolves to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. The IPv4 address
        <strong>185.199.110.153</strong> is a 32-bit address in dotted-decimal format.
        The IPv6 address <strong>2606:50c0:8001::153</strong> is a 128-bit address
        supporting modern dual-stack networking. DNS returns A records for IPv4
        and AAAA records for IPv6.
    </p>

    <h2>3. HTTP vs HTTPS</h2>
    <p>
        This site is served exclusively over <strong>HTTPS</strong> on port 443,
        confirmed by the browser lock icon and Chrome DevTools showing
        <strong>Remote Address: 185.199.110.153:443</strong>. The status code returned
        is <strong>304 Not Modified</strong>, meaning the browser cache was validated.
        TLS encrypts all communication between your browser and GitHub's servers.
