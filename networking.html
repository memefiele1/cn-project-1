    <h2>1. DNS (Domain Name System)</h2>
    <p>
        DNS translates a human-readable domain name into an IP address.
        When a user enters a website URL, DNS resolves that name to the
        server's IP address so the browser knows where to send the request.
    </p>

    <h2>2. IP Addressing</h2>
    <p>
        Every website is hosted on a server with a unique IP address.
        IPv4 addresses are 32-bit and look like 192.168.1.1.
        IPv6 addresses are 128-bit and allow for many more devices
        on the internet.
    </p>

    <h2>3. HTTP vs HTTPS</h2>
    <p>
        HTTP is a protocol used for transferring web data.
        HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP. It encrypts communication
        using TLS over TCP/IP, protecting data between the browser
        and the server.
